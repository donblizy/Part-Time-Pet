<h1 align="center"> Team PTP's Part Time Pet app </h1>

Do you like pets? Borrow a dog; lend your iguana. A pet sharing app for mobile devices using Android or iOS.
<br>


This app was created as part of Northcoder's bootcamp final project by a team of 5.
The general idea involves people borrowing/lending their pets by bringing users together using distance and allowing them to make their own arrangments using a real time chat feature. It is meant to make pets accessible to everyone.

It is intended to be used by individuals who are too busy and sometimes cannot take care of their pet or others who wish to trial owning a pet or even individuals who could use a pet's company to boost their mental health.

You can search for pets using various queries and then organise
your pet shares using our real-time messaging feature. You can
leave reviews on other usersâ€™ profiles and add, edit and delete pets
on your own.
